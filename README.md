### Introduction 
I would be learning data structures and algorithm properly and extensively in 2023(over its span).<br>
During this learning spree: 
- Python programming language would be used as the major tool of implementation.
- Each concept would be documented properly in here.

# Data Structures
### Linked list
An alternative to arrays(better off at times)
#### Features:
  - Insertion
    - Insert at the beginning
    - Insert at the end
    - Insert at index
    - Insert multiple values
  - Deletion
    - Delete by value
    - Delete by index
  - Existence -> bool
  - Get Existence index -> int
  - Length
  - Count of value
  - Print linked list

### Doubly Linked list
Double linked list
#### Features:
  - Insertion
    - Insert at the beginning
    - Insert at the end
    - Insert at index
    - Insert multiple values
  - Deletion
    - Delete by value
    - Delete by index
  - Existence -> bool
  - Get Existence index -> int
  - Length(optimised O(1))
  - Count of value
  - Print linked list forward and backward

### HashMap or HashTable
For storing key-value pair using a hash function
#### Features:
  - Insert key value pair
  - Retrieve value of key
  - Hash function
  - Ensure uniqueness of key
  - Resetting value of a key
  - check if key exists in hash table

### Stack
Implemented using deque(double ended queue) in python. stack operates on the Last in First Out (LIFO) mode
#### Features:
  - get length
  - add to stack
  - pop last item from stack
  - return last item without popping(peek)
  - check if empty
  - print stack
### Queue
Implemented using deque(double ended queue) in python. Queue operates on the First in First Out (FIFO) mode
#### Features:
  - get length
  - add to queue(enqueue)
  - pop first item from stack
  - return first item without popping(peek)
  - check if empty
  - print queue
# Algorithms
## Search
### Linear search 
Search for a number in an array, sorted or unsorted and returns the index, iterates all through to where the number exists
#### Time complexity
O(n)
### Binary search 
Search for a number in a sorted array, and returns the index, divides the array in halves until number is found where existing.
#### Time complexity
O(log n)
